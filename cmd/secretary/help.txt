Usage: secretary [OPTIONS]... -- [COMMAND]
Load secrets into the environment and execute the given command.

secrets are loaded as bash shell scripts with all external execution
disabled. Only simple assignments should be used, e.g.

    shadow_hash=some_shadow_string
    host_lang=${LANG:-C}
    [...]

All environment variables defined in the script will be merged into the
current process environment before COMMAND is executed.

A special environment variable SECRETARY_KEYS contains a space seperated
list of all added variables names.

Running secretary inside secretary will result in an append to SECRETARY_KEYS.

Multiple pass/plain secrets can be specified and they will be loaded in
the specified order.
