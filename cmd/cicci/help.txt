Usage: cicci [OPTIONS]... [FILE|DIR|GLOB]...
Merge cloud-config files and templates into a multipart cloud-config archive.

cicci will scan the current directory if no file is specified.
cicci writes to standard out.

cicci supports the following filetypes (by extension):

  .yaml | .yml | .json               YAML configuration file
  .tpl.yaml | .tpl.yml | .tpl.json   templated YAML file
  .sh | .bash                        shell scripts
  .tpl.sh | .tpl.bash                templated shell scripts

Templates are go templates with the environment loaded as context.
cicci uses `sprig` for template functions.

cicci does a simple YAML parse check before outputting a result.

The cloud-init archive is configured to merge structure as

  merge_how:
   - name: list
     settings: [append]
   - name: dict
     settings: [recurse_list]
